Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing 
from their place. We need a function that counts the number 
of sheep present in the array (true means present).

[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]

  function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
let sheep=0

for (let i=0; i<arrayOfSheep.length; i++){
